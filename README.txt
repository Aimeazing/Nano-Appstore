Welcome to my appstore, Apptitude!
This store has four games to offer that you will defenitely enjoy


Games available
 1. Number guesser
 In this game you have to guess a randomly generated number. In multiplayer mode, a
 second player can choose the number for you to guess. The game will give feedback,
 letting you know whether your guess is too low or too high. In singleplayer mode,
 the number is within a certain range based on the difficulty you select, which can
 variate from easy to impossible!

 2. Hangman
 Hangman is a word-guessing game where you have to guess a hidden word. In this 
 project I gave included a file containing 9700 words for the singleplayer mode,
 from which a random word will be selected for you to guess. This game also has a
 multiplayer option, where the second player has to come up with a word for the
 first player to guess. You have a total of seven incorrect guesses, and with each
 wrong guess, a part of the hangman is drawn. Make sure to guess correct before the
 hangman is completely finished!

 3. Riddles
 This is not necessarily a game, but it provides riddles for you to think about. It
 is not something you can lose or win, nonetheless it can still be fun! The game has 
 a few different catagories from which you can choose from and your riddles will
 also be based on the difficulty level you select. It is up to you when you want to
 get the answer! 

 4. Rock Paper Scissors
 The game Rock Paper Scissors is a game where players choose one of three options:
 rock, paper, or scissors. In single-player mode, you will play against the 
 computer, which randomly selects one of the three options. The rules are simple: 
 rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. The game also has
 a multiplayer mode where two players can go up against each other!


Important information
 1. installations
 Make sure you are on the correct python version (Python 3.6 or higher). Also this
 project requires you to install 'pyfiglet'. This is an external library that I
 used to generate ASCII art. If you have not installed this on your system, please
 type the following in your command prompt:
 pip install pyfiglet

 2. Password
 When you run the game you have to enter a password. This is FreePass123.

 3. Linux or macOS
 If the system you are using runs on Linux or macOS, please replace the clear
 commands for the terminal. The current function is os.system('cls') but that
 must be changed to os.system('clear'). You only have to change the position of
 the '#' on the following positions.
